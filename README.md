Takes a point cloud of scanned asteroid and creates a 3D mesh.

Check out the html renders if you want to take a looksy. 

Meshes or at least parts of the mesh are in the mesh folder.

My computer ran out of space and I ran out of time.

There are three python files in the root of the repo if you like reading code.

- process_vertices.py will download and create meshes.

- stitch_surfaces.py will take already downloaded data and create meshes.

- libhack.py is the bulk of the code for the project.
